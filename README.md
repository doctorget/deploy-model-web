This repository contains a simple case of a Tensorflow neural network model implemented in the web application for the recognition of numbers using TensorflowJS

## about the base
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. More about [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)

## about model

To train this model, convolutional neural networks were used together with data augmentation techniques. training 60,000 images and testing with 10,000. right after training with the test base.
